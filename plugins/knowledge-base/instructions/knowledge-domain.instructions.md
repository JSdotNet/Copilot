# Domain knowledge (`.domain`)

`.domain` is the durable, ubiquitous-language record of the domain model,
organized by bounded context. It is the authoritative source for "what the
domain looks like" — complementary to `.arc42` (system architecture), `.tech`
(technology stack), `.design` (UX guidelines), and `.backlog` (work items).

## Context-loading policy

- `.domain` is **not** baseline repository context. Load it only for domain
  modeling, bounded-context, or ubiquitous-language tasks, normally after
  routing through the repository's domain orchestration or a domain specialist
  agent.
- When `.domain` is needed as task context, load only the relevant bounded
  context's chapters instead of reading the whole folder by default.
- Implementation work consults `.domain` when the change touches domain
  behavior, an aggregate boundary, or naming — not by default.

## Structure

`.domain/` contains one root strategic artifact plus one folder per bounded
context.

Each bounded context gets its own subfolder, named in kebab-case after the
context (e.g. `.domain/order-management/`). Use the same name consistently
across `.domain`, ADRs, and code module names where practical.

```
.domain/
  context-map.md
  <bounded-context-name>/
    domain.md
    features.md
    model.md
    flow.md          # optional: when the context has lifecycle/process flows
    dependencies.md
    naming.md
```

When starting a new bounded context, create the folder and the standard files
(`domain.md`, `features.md`, `model.md`, `dependencies.md`, `naming.md`) using
the templates below, and add `flow.md` when the context has lifecycle or
process flows.

Reading order is declared in Markdown, not inferred from filenames:
`context-map.md` is `.domain`'s root document and its file-level `order` lists
the bounded contexts; each context's `domain.md` is that folder's root document
and its `order` lists the remaining files. Update both when adding a context or
a file, then regenerate `_meta/`. See
`knowledge-chapter-metadata.instructions.md`.

## File responsibilities

- **context-map.md** — Strategic DDD view across bounded contexts at the
  `.domain` root.
  - Documents the subdomain landscape/classification (core/supporting/generic
    as applicable).
  - Captures bounded-context relationships in a context map.
  - Records published languages/contracts used across context boundaries.
  - States strategic rules that constrain cross-context collaboration.
- **domain.md** — One chapter per Aggregate, Domain Service, Domain Event, or
  Shared Value Objects / Shared Enums grouping in the context.
  - Aggregate chapters include sub-chapters for their owned Entities, Value
    Objects, and Enums.
  - Domain Service chapters describe the service's responsibility and the
    aggregates/policies it coordinates.
  - Domain Event chapters are first-class addressable chapters and carry
    metadata blocks like other `domain.md` chapters.
  - Value Objects and Enums **shared across multiple aggregates** within the
    context get their own separate chapter — do not duplicate them under each
    aggregate that uses them.
- **features.md** — The features and sub-features this bounded context
  supports, in business language. Group sub-features under their parent
  feature.
- **model.md** — The structural domain model: relationships between
  aggregates, entities, and value objects, ideally as a Mermaid class diagram,
  plus relationship notes. Lifecycle/process flows live in `flow.md`, not
  here.
- **flow.md** — Lifecycle and process flows for the context (state machines,
  sequence diagrams, flowcharts) — how aggregates move through their states and
  how work moves across the context over time. Moved out of `model.md` so
  `model.md` stays purely structural. Include only when the context actually
  has a flow. Its `##` sections do not carry metadata blocks.
- **dependencies.md** — Outbound dependencies on other bounded contexts or
  modules, and known inbound dependents.
  - Use explicit DDD relationship semantics (`ACL`, `Customer/Supplier`,
    `Partnership`, `OHS + Published Language`, etc.) instead of ad hoc
    integration prose.
  - For each relationship, document DDD pattern, integration mechanism,
    contract, and why/what the dependency relies on.
- **naming.md** — The context's ubiquitous-language naming registry: one
  `## Term: <Canonical>` chapter per key term. Surface synonyms are recorded in
  the `aliases` metadata field; a `related` reference links the term to the
  chapter where it is modeled. This gives every synonym (code class name, id
  field, consumer-side copy) a single canonical concept.

## Folder rules

These rules describe the persisted shape of `.domain` assets only. Authoring
workflow, routing, and cross-document governance are handled by separate
instructions.
- Every Aggregate, Domain Service, Domain Event, Shared Value Objects, and
  Shared Enums chapter in `domain.md`, every Feature/Sub-feature chapter in
  `features.md`, and every `## Term` chapter in `naming.md` must carry a
  metadata block as described in
  `knowledge-chapter-metadata.instructions.md`. Only `status` is
  required; the optional cross-folder tags (`related`) and issue link
  (`issue`) are included only when they have a value.
- Every file in `.domain` — `context-map.md` and, per bounded context,
  `domain.md`, `features.md`, `model.md`, `flow.md` (when present),
  `dependencies.md`, and `naming.md` — must also carry the file-level
  metadata block described in
  `knowledge-chapter-metadata.instructions.md`, placed directly
  under the file's top-level `#` heading. This applies even to
  `context-map.md`, `model.md`, `flow.md`, and `dependencies.md`, whose `##`
  sections do not carry their own per-chapter blocks — the file-level block
  is the only metadata those files carry.
- The metadata block's `status` field uses `draft`, `proposed`, `active`, or
  `deprecated` in this folder. Domain knowledge describes the current (or
  agreed-future) model, not a task queue, so there is no `done`: `active`
  means "this is the current model", `deprecated` means superseded.
- `features.md` Feature/Sub-feature chapters may carry an additional
  `depends-on` field: a list of `<path>#<heading-slug>` references (see
  `knowledge-chapter-metadata.instructions.md` for the reference
  format) to other features that must be delivered first, e.g.
  `depends-on: [.domain/order-management/features.md#feature-refunds]`.
  `domain.md` chapters (Aggregates, Domain Services, Domain Events, Shared
  Value Objects/Enums) do not use `depends-on` — they describe standing
  structure, and their relationships belong in `model.md`/`dependencies.md` or
  the `related` field instead.
- `features.md` Feature/Sub-feature chapters may carry an additional
  `feature-flag` field: the key (or keys) of the application feature flag that
  delivers this chapter in the running product, e.g. `feature-flag: inbox-pane`
  or, when several flags together deliver one chapter,
  `feature-flag: [inbox-pane, inbox-filters]`. One flag may equally appear on
  several chapters. Unlike `related`/`depends-on`, entries are plain
  application identifiers, not `<path>#<heading-slug>` references — the flag
  lives in the application's own catalog, not in this repository, so the field
  produces no graph edge and the key itself is never validated here. Omit the
  field when the chapter has no flag. `domain.md` and `naming.md` chapters do
  not use `feature-flag`: a flag delivers a capability, not a structural
  element or a term.

  This link is an **identity** link only — it says "this chapter and that flag
  are the same capability". It is deliberately **not** a status mapping. The
  `status` values above describe how settled the written model is; a feature
  flag's own maturity describes whether the running behaviour can be relied on.
  Those answer different questions, so do not translate one vocabulary into the
  other, and do not infer a chapter's `status` from its flag's maturity or the
  reverse.
- In `dependencies.md`, use explicit DDD relationship terminology for each
  cross-context row when applicable (for example: `ACL`,
  `Customer/Supplier`, `Partnership`, `OHS + Published Language`) and identify
  the contract/published language entry used by consumers.
- In Domain Service chapters, state invocation semantics when it clarifies
  behavior boundaries: whether logic is command-invoked, scheduled,
  query/composition-oriented, or event-triggered policy/process-manager
  behavior.
- Do not introduce a separate `policy.md` or a distinct `Policy` chapter type
  just to document process-manager behavior; keep that semantics in the
  relevant Domain Service chapter unless a separate structure is later decided
  explicitly.
- `naming.md` `Term` chapters carry an `aliases` field: a list of
  plain-string surface names the term is also known by (code class/identifier
  names, snake_case id fields, or a consumer context's local copy name).
  Unlike `related`/`depends-on`, `aliases` entries are plain strings, not
  `<path>#<heading-slug>` references — the link to the canonical modeling
  chapter is carried by that term's `related` field instead. Omit `aliases`
  when the term has none.

## Outbound dependencies

| Depends on (context/module) | DDD pattern | Integration mechanism | Contract | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <OtherContext> | <ACL / Customer-Supplier / Partnership / OHS + Published Language> | <event, API call, registry lookup, id link, etc.> | <published language / contract chapter reference> | <reason this context needs it> |

## Inbound dependents (known)

| Consumer (context/module) | DDD pattern | Integration mechanism | Contract | What it relies on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <OtherContext> | <ACL / Customer-Supplier / Partnership / OHS + Published Language> | <how the consumer integrates> | <published language / contract chapter reference> | <what would break if changed> |

## Notes

- Prefer explicit DDD pattern names over free-text integration wording.
- Flag any dependency that crosses a bounded-context boundary without an
  anti-corruption layer or published language, so it can be revisited.
- Link to the relevant `domain-interaction-diagram` / `context-mapping`
  artifact if one exists for this relationship, instead of duplicating it.
